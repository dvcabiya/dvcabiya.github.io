        <h3>weird errors you may run into</h3>
        <ul>
            <li style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bolder;">with the nw-a16</li>
            <ul>
                <li>the nw-a16 is a little picky with what it chooses to display sometimes.</li>
                <li>for album covers, i always right click the cover in mp3tag and set the resolution to <code>Max Size: 500px</code></li>
                <li>sometimes you'll have a perfectly fine album cover that's 500x500px and still doesn't render on the nw-a16. whenever this happens i just look up <code>{album title} spotify</code> and download the cover from google images since it's usually reasonable quality and such. if the spotify cover looks bad you can also go on archive.org and any album you download will have in the Download Options <code>JPEG</code>, which is also a good place, and oftentimes you can find really high quality scans here</li>
                <li>I usually stick to just JPEGs since any other file format doesn't reliably work in my experience</li>
            </ul>
