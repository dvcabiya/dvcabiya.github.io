# [dvcabiya.github.io](https://dvcabiya.github.io/)

personal website where i put some stuff
mostly meaningless, but a bit of it is mildly interesting, like:
- workshop on git i lead for ub acm, link to [repo](https://github.com/dvcabiya/acm) and the [deployed site](https://dvcabiya.github.io/acm)

otherwise, it's just fun to have this site. i like how really bad html looks
