## my website for silly activities (blog posts and assorted projects)
While [vcabiya.com](http://vcabiya.com/) is my professional portfolio, this site is where I just do whatever I feel like. If I alredy had a lot of professional experience, my portfolio would probably look like this. In fact, this homepage might get destroyed after I no longer feel the need to have a super flashy portfolio.

That being said:
This will mainly be where I host projects
I might write an occasional post on here.
